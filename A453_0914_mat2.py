##a453 programming project 2, released sept 14 for jun 16
##A primary school teacher wants a computer program to test the basic arithmetic skills of her students.
##The program should generate a quiz consisting of a series of random questions, using in each case
##any two numbers and addition, subtraction and multiplication. The system should ask the studentâ€™s
##name, then ask 10 questions, output if the answer to each question is correct or not and produce a final
##score out of 10.
##Analyse the requirements in detail and design, code, test and evaluate a program to meet these
##requirements.
